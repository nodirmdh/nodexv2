## Business rules
- **Single backend + single database** for all interfaces.
- **One vendor = one physical point** with `address_text` and geo coordinates (lat/lng).
- **Pickup (self-pickup)** is allowed **only for RESTAURANTS** and only if `vendor.supports_pickup = true`.

## Fees (service fee + delivery fee)

- **Service fee** applies to **all orders** (DELIVERY and PICKUP):
  - `service_fee = 3000`
- **Delivery fee** applies only to DELIVERY orders:
  - `delivery_fee = 3000 + ceil(distance_km) * 1000`
  - This implies a **minimum delivery fee of 3000** even for very short distances.
  - `distance_km` is haversine distance from vendor geo to client delivery geo.
- **Pickup orders**:
  - `delivery_fee = 0`
  - `service_fee = 3000`
- **Delivery comment is required** for every delivery order.

## Promotions requirements
- Supported promotion types:
  - `FIXED_PRICE`
  - `PERCENT`
  - `COMBO`
  - `BUY_X_GET_Y`

- Apply promotions in order:
  1. `COMBO`
  2. `BUY_X_GET_Y`
  3. `FIXED_PRICE` / `PERCENT`
  4. `GIFT`
  5. Promo code (optional, order-level)
- Client must see counters:
  - `promo_items_count`
  - `combo_count`
  - `buyxgety_count`
  - `gift_count`

## Client saved promo codes
- Clients can store promo codes in Profile → “Promo Codes”.
- Promo codes are **global** and managed in Admin.
